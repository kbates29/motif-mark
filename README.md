# motif-mark

Splicing.py takes a fasta file that has introns in lowercase and exons in uppercase, as well as a file with motifs you wish to search for in those sequences and then returns a svg image that highlights introns, exons and the location of the motif. An example of this is shown in Motifs.svg.

A random color generator was used to populate colors for each motif. If you get two colors that are similar re-run the program.
